During the next exercise class I would like to talk with each Team about the security analysis of the project that is implemented by the Team.
Please consider the following questions:



What are the assets in my projects?

Primary assets:
confidentialy and integrity of username, photos
availability of the service
correcteness of authentication process

Supporting assets:
hardware on client side
cryptographic keys
password



Also we don’t want others to know our method of user authentication or else they could attempt to spoof user login



What threats should be considered in case of my project?

1. The threat is that someone can either steal the photos 
2. steal account data - get access to restricted stuff or by hack attack
3. they can crack our algorithms without having user photos. 
	For example, they steal our Python code and calculate that passing a certain vector gets accepted as user login
	and if they steal our encryption key for photos, they can decrypt photos
4. Fake server taking the photos to steal our data  (phishing)
5. Image of the face change over time to preserve honest level of the authentication the data base should be updated



What controls should be implemented/deployed to mitigate the threats?

To mitigate risk:

1) don’t allow users to submit their own Photos. Photos only taken by our secure application 
2) check photo is a photo of living person
3) encrypt photos, vector of photos and change encryption key every few months,
4) encrypt Python code,  files as well
5) optionally , cross validate new photos using secondary algorithm e.g. use both eigen and fischer
6) provide new photos every year to update data
7) There should exist TLS channel between server and application
